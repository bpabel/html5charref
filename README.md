Python library for escaping/unescaping HTML5 Named Character References.

The standard library includes the [HTMLParser](https://docs.python.org/2/library/htmlparser.html)
for unescaping HTML named entities and HTML unicode escapes.  Unfortunately,
it doesn't include any of the named character entity references defined in
[HTML5](http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref).  This library 
intends to provide a solution for escaping/unescaping HTML
character references from HTML5.
