=============

Python library for escaping/unescaping HTML5 Named Character References.

The standard python library includes the `HTMLParser`_ package
for unescaping HTML named entities and HTML unicode escapes.  Unfortunately,
it doesn't include any of the named character entity references defined in
`HTML5`_.  This library intends to provide a solution for 
escaping/unescaping HTML character references defined in HTML5.
